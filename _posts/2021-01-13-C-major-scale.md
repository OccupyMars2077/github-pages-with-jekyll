<p>To understand the minor scale we must first understand the major scale. A scale is a patter of music notes that when played sound good together.</p> 
The C Major scale is C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C. Each scale typically consists of 7 notes, beginning with Root Note. In this example C and continues on until you reach the Octive of the Root or beginning note.A full octive is 12 semitones apart.
The formula to build any major scale is (Whole Step - Whole Step - Half Step - Whole Step - Whole Step - Whole Step - Half Step)
To make a Major Chord we start at the Root ( C ) 1, move to the 3rd note in the scale (E), and add the 5th (G).
